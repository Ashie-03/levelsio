Can you code the entire game for me? 
Create a Space themed single player game like website where the user will be given a set of tasks, they have to complete missions to see different sections of the page.

Have a map on the top bar for easy exploration

This is how the game goes - 

Suit up - The user is told a story (they are going on a Vibe Mission to space)

Then they see a futuristic Terminal like set up - task is to launch the spaceship bu pulling down the lever - once user pulls down the lever, a countdown of 5 starts, and the space ship launches.

The screen goes black and comes backin 2secs - now the user has Successfully landed in space - notification on terminal with instructions: "Congrats on landing safely. Complete your missions to come back to Earth. You can see a map on the top to hep you navigate. Happy Vibe Mission"

Then users can freely move around using arrows (if using keyboards) or by dragging with fingers (on mobile).

The space ship has 5 areas - electrical, zero-gravity zone, Data center, Laboratory

The tasks for each area is as follows - 

Electrical - user fix broken wires - when successfully done, they get to read the rules of the game

Laboratory - user solves a simple chemical game to test something - when successfull they get to see the list of Jury

Zero-gravity zone - users catch coins floating in zero-gravity, by also avoiding sharp objects in between - when successfull they get to see the prizes list

Oxygen fix - Users get a emergency notification that oxygen levels are low - they must signup the form to fix the issue. When they click the fix oxygen button, they're redirect to a page (google forms)

This is a interactive 2d game - users can move around freely (there should be no restrictions). 

get inspo from the game "Among Us" but don't simply copy it. Include my ideas while still keeping the experience like the game

Keep the tasks simple and easy to do. 

Write React, Vite, Ts code for this game. Use images and components from freely available sources. Give me fully working code.
